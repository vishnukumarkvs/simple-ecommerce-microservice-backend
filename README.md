There are many options for building an authentication microservice, and the best choice will depend on your specific needs and requirements. Here are a few options you might consider:

Passport.js is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js that can be used to authenticate users in a variety of ways, including using local username and password credentials, OAuth2, and third-party authentication services like Google and Facebook.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a popular standard for securely transmitting information between parties. You can use JWT to build your own authentication service or use a third-party library like jsonwebtoken to handle the heavy lifting.

Auth0 is a cloud-based identity and access management platform that provides a wide range of authentication and authorization features. It supports multiple authentication methods, including username and password, social logins, and single sign-on (SSO).

is Auth0  free?
Auth0 is a paid service, but it does offer a free tier that includes some basic features. The free tier includes:

Unlimited login transactions
Single sign-on (SSO)
User management
Basic multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Universal Login (customizable login pages)
The free tier has some limitations, including:

A maximum of 7,000 active users
No access to premium features, such as advanced MFA options and rule execution
No access to support beyond community support forums
If you need more advanced features or higher levels of support, you will need to upgrade to one of Auth0's paid plans. You can find more information about the different plans and pricing on the Auth0 website.
